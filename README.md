## 🧠 About Me

- 💻 Self-declared full-stack dev (aka: I break both front and back)
- 🐍 Fluent in: Python, JavaScript, and Googling error messages
- ⚠️ 99% of my commits are followed by: “don’t ask how, but it works”
- 🔁 Constantly stuck in a loop of:
  1. Break code
  2. Fix code
  3. Forget how I fixed it
  4. Repeat

| Tailwind CSS    | Express        | Postman      | "Temporary" fixes     |
| HTML/CSS        | MongoDB        | Heroku (lol) | `rm -rf /*` survivor  |

## 🔍 Current Status:

```js
const developer = {
  sleep: "depends on the bug",
  caffeine: "stronger than my will to debug",
  productivity: Math.random() > 0.5 ? "sky high" : "existential crisis",
  codeQuality: "undefined",
};
```

## 📝 Fun Fact

I once spent 3 hours fixing a bug, gave up, went to sleep — it fixed itself.  
**10/10 would pretend I did it on purpose.**

📬 Find me in the terminal… probably crying over a missing semicolon.
